Library functions and utilities
-------------------------------

* `eval-get-values.rkt`

  Wrapper for the racket `eval` function that allows the evaluation of code
  with multiple return values in typed/racket.

* `main.rkt`
  
  Utilities that complement racket and typed/racket's standard libraries.

* `untyped-only/for-star-list-star.rkt`

  A utility macro similar to `for*/list` to iterate over collections and return
  a list of results, but which can return nested lists instead of just a flat
  one.

* `test-framework.rkt`
  
  Some wrappers and utilities that allow easier use of the rackunit test
  framework from typed/racket files.

* `list-lang.rkt`

  Tiny programming language extension that allows constructing a list with the
  contents of all trailing lines in the file. This makes appending data to the
  list easy, as there is no need to remove the last closing parentheses and add
  them back afterwards â€” simply appending an s-expression to the file works.
  Alternatively, one could avoid using this language by appending an
  instruction of the form:
  
      (set! list (cons item list))
